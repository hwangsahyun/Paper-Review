## ml-paper-reproduction

### 📈 Overview

This repository contains implementations and reproduction experiments of machine learning and statistical methods based on research papers and selected university coursework.

The primary goal of this repository is **methodological understanding and reproducibility**, rather than performance optimization or production-level engineering.  
Through reproducing experimental results and re-implementing algorithms, I aim to better understand the assumptions, limitations, and theoretical foundations behind data-driven methods.

This repository reflects my academic interest in **data science as a theoretically grounded and reproducible discipline**, rather than a black-box application. 🙋🏻‍♀️

### 💭 Motivation

As a major in 📈 **Statistics** with a double major in 💻 **Software**, I became interested in data science at the intersection of mathematical modeling, algorithmic reasoning, and computational implementation.

To deepen my understanding beyond lectures, I focused on:
- Reading and analyzing machine learning/deep learning and data science research papers
- Reproducing experimental results to verify reported findings
- Implementing algorithms to understand their structural components and assumptions

This repository documents that learning process.

## Contents

### 1. 📑 Paper Reproduction Projects

Reproduction studies based on selected ML/DL and statistical learning papers.

Each project typically includes:
- A summary of the problem setting and methodology
- Reconstructed experimental setup
- Reproduction of key results and trends (not necessarily exact numerical matches)
- Observations on assumptions, limitations, and model behavior

Topics include:
- Clustering and representation learning
- Statistical modeling approaches
- Optimization-based learning methods

(Details of individual papers are described in each subdirectory.)

### 2. 🗂️ Coursework-Based Analysis Projects

Selected implementations developed as part of undergraduate coursework.

These projects usually involve:
- Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis
- Algorithm or model implementation
- Evaluation and interpretation of results
- Accompanying written reports explaining methodological choices

The focus is placed on **clarity of reasoning and interpretability**, rather than extensive software engineering.

## 🛠️ Methodological Focus

Across all projects, I emphasize the following principles:

- **Reproducibility**  
  Experiments are designed to be repeatable, with clearly specified settings and assumptions.

- **Theoretical Understanding**  
  Priority is given to understanding why a method works, not only how to apply it.

- **Interpretation over Optimization**  
  Model behavior and assumptions are analyzed before pursuing performance tuning.

## ⚙️ Tools & Environment

- **Languages:** Python (primary), R (occasionally)
- **Libraries:** NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch (for selected reproductions)
- **Analysis:** Jupyter Notebook
- **Version Control:** Git
